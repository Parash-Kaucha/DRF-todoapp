This project is basically for the beginners who is trying to understand Django Rest Framework.
Whole concept taken from serializers to view function is similar to django.
Only new topics we need to learn is the serializer whose work is to convert the json format data to python compatible data types and vice versa.
Mostly a dictonary and a list is considered to be a compatible data type as data is retrived from the database.
If the data is retrived in the form of stream like multiple instances, list data type will be used to store multiple instances.
JSONParser and JSONRenderer is used to convert json data into python data type and python data to json data respectively.
